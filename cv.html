    His first bounty was 60,000,000 Berries after he defeated over 100 bounty hunters of Whiskey Peek and Daz Bones/Mr.1. His Second bounty was 120,000,000 Berries after the Straw Hat declared war against the World Government and he defeated Kaku. His third bounty is 320,000,000 Berries after he defeated the top executive of the Spade seat Pica of the Donquixote Pirates. His current bounty is 1,111,000,000 berries after he defeated King as well retaking his place as the second most wanted of the Straw Hat Pirates from Sanji, who he now calls "No. 4". Zoro was guarding Thousand Sunny while sleeping until his nap was interrupted by Kaku (who failed in his attempted to destroy Sunny) and clashed his longtime CP enemy.

<h2>Appearance</h2>
<p>
    Zoro is a relatively tall man with a muscular physique and light tanned skin with distinctive spiky green hair which Sanji regularly ridicules him for by calling him "Moss Head". He has a stitched scar on his chest which he got from his first duel with Dracule Mihawk and has multple scars on his body from his days as a bounty hunter (which sometimes appear in the manga). He also has a set of three golden earrings on his left ear and wears a black bandana wrapped around his left arm which he wears on his head whenever he gets serious in a fight. He holds his signature three swords on the right side of his hips due to being left-handed.

His main Pre-Timeskip attire is normally a white plain shirt with three unbuttoned buttons, black trousers with a green haramaki, and black boots though his outfit varies throughout the series.

After the 2-year timeskip, Zoro has gotten notably more muscular and his hair has grown longer. He also has a new scar over his left eye, which he has closed; how he acquired it is unknown. He now wears an open long green coat, held together with a red sash that leaves his chest and his green haramaki exposed.
